# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains files related to the Loan Approval Prediction project, aimed at developing a predictive model for loan approval. The primary dataset, `LoanApprovalPrediction.csv`, serves as the foundation for training and testing the predictive model.

## File Descriptions

1. **LoanApprovalPrediction.csv**: The dataset containing relevant information for the loan approval prediction.

2. **LoanPrediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file designed for the analysis, exploration, and development of the loan approval prediction model. This notebook can be run using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. **loan_app.py**: Python script specifically tailored for deployment using Streamlit on the Spyder IDE.

## Usage Instructions

### Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

1. Open `LoanPrediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to analyze and develop the loan approval prediction model.

### Spyder IDE with Streamlit

1. Ensure that Streamlit is installed. If not, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. Open Spyder IDE.

3. Run the `loan_app.py` script using the following command in the Spyder console:
    ```bash
    streamlit run loan_app.py
    ```

This command will initiate the loan approval prediction application, allowing users to interact with the model through a Streamlit interface.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and contribute to the project as needed.

## Note

Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the appropriate Python environment is set up before running the code.

Happy coding!
